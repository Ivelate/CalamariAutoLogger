# CalamariAutoLogger
Automatically logs worked hours into Calamari. Useful when you have a lot of non-logged days and you don't want to do it by hand :)

# Usage
Just open the script and edit the marked parameters. After that is done, just run it!
You must have installed the appropiate browser. Right now, only firefox is supported.
